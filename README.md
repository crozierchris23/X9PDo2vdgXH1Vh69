ðŸ“˜ ACME Happy Customers

ðŸ§  Introduction

I have recently completed a project for Apziva. I am including the URL for the project for those interested in learning more: https://github.com/crozierchris23/X9PDo2vdgXH1Vh69/blob/main/ACME-Happy%20Customers.ipynb

ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose & Goals

This project explores customer satisfaction data for the ACME Corporation. The objective is to understand what factors contribute to customer happiness and to use data-driven insights to help the company improve its service quality and retention.

ðŸ§­ Notebook Overview

1. Introduction
   
An initial introduction explaining what the problem is and what the intended goal is. Several Python libraries have been imported and will be used throughout the project to provide analytics.

2. Data Analytics
   
Basic exploration of the data provided to help understand customer happiness and the attributes we are interested in investigating. Basic descriptive statistics are shown for each attribute and a heatmap is also provided in this section to see the degrees of correlation between each attribute

3. Visualizations of the Data
   
Graphs of the data are provided to help analyze trends and see if anything shows in the data that may lead to hypotheses on what may affect customer happiness.

4. Building a Model and Selecting Evaluation Methods
   
The initial test and training models are set up with the knowledge that is gained so far. Evaluation methods are selected based upon what might be considered best for this case. The three selected are RandomForestClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, and LogisticRegression. Feature Engineering then selects the 3 attributes most likely to affect Customer Happiness based from these models, the results are ensembled using VotingClassifier, and then the threshold is improved to test the overall validity of the results.

5. Conclusion of the Results
    
A summary of the results of the project. The 3 variables most likely to affect Customer Happiness are stated here based upon the results, the results of the training model being tested, and guidance is provided on what the next steps would be to make the most of the results moving forward.

ðŸ§¾ Concluding Remarks

The goal of this project was to develop my skills and showcase my knowledge of machine learning and AI in order to solve a real-world problem that may exist. Understanding what influences customer interactions is important for businesses, and utilizing machine learning to analyze and draw conclusions from the data presented can be a valuable tool to help businesses better understand how to reach their customer base, improve customer retention, and draw in new potential customers.
If you are impressed with how I utilized machine learning to analyze and come up with the results, then please reach out to me!
